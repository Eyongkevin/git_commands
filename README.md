## WORKING INSTRUCTIONS

Hi everyone! 
We've been tasked with describing all the git commands we know so far in the form of Markdown Syntax.

I believe the main point of this excercise is not to test our knowledge of git commands, but to force us to work in a team using git and github in tandem.

This being said, please follow this workflow to ensure we're all on the same page:

1. clone this repository into your terminal. (make sure you clone it into a free directory)
2. **Create a branch** with the same name as the command you are assigned; eg: git switch config / make sure you are working in this branch from now on.
3. **Create a mardown file (.md)** with the same name as the command; eg: touch config.md 
4. Go crazy! Open up VSCode and write all about this command. Help yourself with online resources to make sure there's enough information, and utilize markdown to its full potential to make your page look pretty.
