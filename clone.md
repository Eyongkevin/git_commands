# The `git` **clone** command

Although humans can't quite clone yet, git sure can, and a great tool it is. Following are a few of its <u>capabilities</u>:

Git's **clone** command has *one* function at its core: clone a repository into a new directory. However, there are many flavors to this tool.

It can create remote-tracking branches for each branch in a cloned repository, and creates and checks out an inital branch that is forked from the cloned repository's currently active branch, given some configuration.

## Some options for this command are:

<mark>-l</mark>, --local

<mark>-s</mark>, --shared

<mark>-q</mark>, --quiet

<mark>-v</mark>, --verbose

<mark>--progress</mark>

<mark>-n</mark>, --no-checkout

and many more!
